# Snapshot Governance

Query, vote, and create proposals on Snapshot — the leading off-chain governance platform for DAOs.

## Setup

### Dependencies

The query script needs only `curl` and `jq`.

The vote and propose scripts need `@ethersproject/address` for EIP-55 checksumming:

```bash
npm ls @ethersproject/address 2>/dev/null || npm i @ethersproject/address
```

No `snapshot.js` dependency required — the scripts build EIP-712 payloads and talk to the sequencer directly.

### Authentication

- **Reading (GraphQL queries):** No auth needed. Optional `SNAPSHOT_API_KEY` header for higher rate limits.
- **Writing (vote/propose):** Uses `bankr wallet sign` for EIP-712 signing — no private key export needed.
- The scripts auto-detect the signer address via `bankr whoami`. Override with `--from 0x...` if needed.

### ⚠️ Bankr API Key Restrictions

Bankr's default API key may have **trusted-recipient restrictions** that block EIP-712 typed-data signing for non-transaction messages (Snapshot uses a domain with no `verifyingContract`, so there's no address to whitelist).

If signing fails with a 403 error about trusted recipients, temporarily swap `~/.bankr/config.json` to use an **unrestricted API key** (e.g., the CoW Swap key if you have one), then swap back after.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Tool |
|--------|------|
| Query spaces/proposals/votes | `scripts/snapshot-query.sh` |
| Cast a vote | `scripts/snapshot-vote.mjs` |
| Create a proposal | `scripts/snapshot-propose.mjs` |
| Detailed query patterns | `references/graphql-api.md` |
| Voting type formats | `references/voting-types.md` |

## Workflows

### 1. Query Proposals in a Space

```bash
bash scripts/snapshot-query.sh '{
  proposals(first: 10, where: {space_in: ["ens.eth"], state: "active"},
    orderBy: "created", orderDirection: desc) {
    id title choices start end state scores scores_total type
    space { id name }
  }
}'
```

### 2. Get Proposal Details

```bash
bash scripts/snapshot-query.sh '{
  proposal(id: "0x...") {
    id title body choices start end snapshot state type
    author scores scores_total scores_by_strategy
    space { id name }
  }
}'
```

### 3. Check Voting Power

Before voting, verify the user has voting power on the proposal:

```bash
bash scripts/snapshot-query.sh '{
  vp(voter: "0xYOUR_ADDRESS", space: "ens.eth", proposal: "0x...") {
    vp vp_by_strategy vp_state
  }
}'
```

If `vp` is 0, the address had no qualifying tokens at the proposal's snapshot block.

### 4. Check Existing Vote

```bash
bash scripts/snapshot-query.sh '{
  votes(where: {proposal: "0x...", voter: "0xYOUR_ADDRESS"}) {
    id choice vp created
  }
}'
```

### 5. Cast a Vote

Read `references/voting-types.md` to determine the correct choice format for the proposal type.

```bash
node scripts/snapshot-vote.mjs \
  --space "ens.eth" \
  --proposal "0xabc123..." \
  --choice 1 \
  --type "single-choice" \
  --reason "Agree with the proposal rationale"
```

For weighted/quadratic: `--choice '{"1":70,"2":30}'`
For approval: `--choice '[1,3]'`
For ranked-choice: `--choice '[2,1,3]'`

Signing is handled by `bankr wallet sign` — no private key needed.

### 6. Create a Proposal

For long proposal bodies, write the markdown to a file and use `--body-file`:

```bash
node scripts/snapshot-propose.mjs \
  --space "your-space.eth" \
  --title "Proposal Title" \
  --body-file /tmp/proposal-body.md \
  --choices '["For","Against","Abstain"]' \
  --type "basic" \
  --start $(date -d '+1 hour' +%s) \
  --end $(date -d '+7 days' +%s)
```

Or pass short bodies inline with `--body "text"`.

The script auto-fetches the latest block for the snapshot parameter if omitted.
Signing is handled by `bankr wallet sign` — no private key needed.

### 7. Get Space Info

```bash
bash scripts/snapshot-query.sh '{
  space(id: "ens.eth") {
    id name about network symbol
    members admins
    strategies { name params }
    voting { delay period quorum type }
    filters { minScore onlyMembers }
  }
}'
```

### 8. Get Vote Results

```bash
bash scripts/snapshot-query.sh '{
  votes(first: 1000, where: {proposal: "0x..."},
    orderBy: "vp", orderDirection: desc) {
    voter choice vp reason created
  }
}'
```

### 9. Check Follows / Subscriptions

```bash
bash scripts/snapshot-query.sh '{
  follows(first: 50, where: {follower: "0xYOUR_ADDRESS"}) {
    space { id name } created
  }
}'
```

## Presentation Guidelines

When presenting proposal or vote data to the user:

- Show proposal status prominently: 🟢 Active, 🟡 Pending, 🔴 Closed
- Format timestamps as human-readable dates
- Show vote tallies as percentages alongside raw scores
- For active proposals, show time remaining until end
- Choices are **1-indexed** — choice 1 is the first option listed
- Always check voting power before attempting to vote
- Always check for existing votes before casting (Snapshot allows changing votes on active proposals but it's good to confirm)

## Important Notes

- Snapshot voting is **off-chain** (gasless) — no transaction fees
- Votes are signed messages (EIP-712) submitted to the Snapshot hub sequencer
- Voting power is calculated at the **snapshot block** when the proposal was created — tokens acquired after are not counted
- Rate limit: 100 req/min without API key, 2M/month with key
- Snapshot hub URL: `https://hub.snapshot.org/graphql`
- Testnet hub: `https://testnet.hub.snapshot.org/graphql`

## Delegation

Snapshot supports vote delegation via the Gnosis Delegate Registry contract (`0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446`) deployed on multiple networks including Base. Delegation is an on-chain transaction (not gasless). Spaces must include a `with-delegation` voting strategy for delegated power to count.

To check delegation status, query the delegate registry subgraph or use `snapshot.js` `follow`/`unfollow` methods.
