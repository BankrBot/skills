// ── WHY A HIRER IDENTITY IS REQUIRED, AND WHY THIS USED TO BE A TRAP ────────
//
// This script used to mint a FRESH ephemeral hirer identity on every run and
// seal with it. Sealing worked, and so did paying — but the rail resolves BOTH
// parties from the agent registry at REDEMPTION, which happens AFTER
// settlement. An unregistered DID is refused there with 403
// `session_identity_unresolved`. So the old flow let a user pay for something
// they could never redeem: money gone, brief sealed, no result.
//
// @voidly/session@1.3.0 exports no registration call (there is no
// `registerAgent` in its export surface), and this skill does not POST by
// design. So the fix is the other route named in the
// review: REFUSE TO SEAL until the hirer DID actually resolves on the rail,
// with the remedy named. `--mint-identity` produces the keypair and prints the
// exact registration request for you to run; sealing then requires `--hirer`
// pointing at that file, and performs one read-only GET to confirm the DID
// resolves, is active, and derives from its registered key — the same three
// questions `resolvePartiesOrRefuse` asks at redemption.
//
// What sealing does: verifies the pinned provider (same as discover.mjs),
// confirms your hirer identity resolves, seals the brief to the provider's
// verified encryption key, and prints the resulting wire envelopes. What it
// does NOT do: it never POSTs anything, never signs a payment, never touches a
// wallet.
//
// ── WHO CAN READ THE BRIEF ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The brief is sealed TO THE PROVIDER's verified encryption key. The provider
// decrypts and reads it — that is how the work gets done. What the seal keeps
// the brief from is the RELAY and anyone on the wire. The only pinned provider
// is Voidly's own first-party daemon, so on this skill's reviewed path the
// party that reads your brief is Voidly. Do not treat sealing as privacy from
// the provider; it is privacy from everyone else.
//
// The session key is the ONE secret this mints that later opens the paid-for
// result. Without --keep it is destroyed on exit (fine for a dry run). With
// --keep FILE, the session key is written to FILE (0600) alongside the wire —
// required to later submit this exact hire and read back its result. The keep
// file is worth at most one payment; treat it like a ticket, not like a wallet
// key.
//
// Exit 0 sealed / 1 refused, by name.

 * THE PREFLIGHT THE OLD FLOW DID NOT HAVE.
 *
 * Asks the rail the same three questions `resolvePartiesOrRefuse` asks at
 * redemption, using the public read-only identity endpoint:
 *
 *   1. Is there a row for this DID at all?      404 -> not registered
 *   2. Is it active?                            deactivated cannot hire
 *   3. Does its registered key DERIVE the DID?  a non-derivable row is refused
 *      at redemption with its own code, and would strand a paid session
 *
 * Plus one this script can ask and the rail cannot: is the registered key the
 * key you are about to sign with? A mismatch means you are sealing under
 * someone else's name and your signatures will not verify.
 *
 * Read-only, one GET. The only thing transmitted is the DID, which is public
 * and which the rail sees on every leg anyway.
