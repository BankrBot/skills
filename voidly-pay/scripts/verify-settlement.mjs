// transaction settled ONE specific hire. Pure Node: no npm dependencies (the
// reviewed constants come from lib/pins.mjs), no keys, no writes. The only
// network calls are read-only JSON-RPC to the public Base endpoints you name.
//
//   node scripts/verify-settlement.mjs \
//     --tx 0x<64-hex> --grant ./keep.grant.json \
//     [--rpc https://mainnet.base.org --rpc https://base.drpc.org] \

//
//   or, without the grant file (the terms are then YOURS, not the grant's):
//
//   node scripts/verify-settlement.mjs \
//     --tx 0x<64-hex> --grant-hash <64-hex> \
//     --payer 0x<40-hex> --payee 0x<40-hex> --amount <atomic-usdc> ...
//
// Two modes, and the verdict names which one it is in:
//   --grant FILE   reads the task-grant envelope seal-hire.mjs wrote beside
//                  your keep file, recomputes its hash exactly as
//                  @voidly/session's envelopeHash does (no dependency needed),
//                  takes payer and payee FROM THE GRANT (the from/to the SDK
//                  signs into the authorization), and requires the settled
//                  amount to sit inside the grant's price band
//                  price_min_amount..price_max_amount — the builders sign the
//                  floor, the SDK's provider-side binding accepts the band.
//                  This is the mode in which "settled THIS hire" is literally
//                  what was checked. --grant-hash/--payer/--payee/--amount may
//                  still be given; each must agree with the grant or the run
//                  refuses grant_terms_mismatch.
//   typed          no --grant: the nonce still binds the transaction to the
//                  grant HASH you typed, but payer, payee and amount are
//                  asserted exactly as you typed them. True of the chain;
//                  silent about whether those are the grant's terms.
//
// What "PROVEN" means here, and nothing more:
//   0. The quorum, decided BEFORE a single packet leaves: HTTPS only,
//      allowlisted hosts only (ALLOWED_BASE_RPC_HOSTS in lib/pins.mjs, unless
//      --allow-unpinned-rpc), and at least two DISTINCT operators once
//      duplicates collapse — independence is counted by host, so naming one
//      operator twice is one operator. Every operator must also report Base
//      mainnet (eth_chainId 0x2105) before anything else it says is believed.
//   1. Receipt identity. Every operator's receipt must say, in its own
//      `transactionHash`, that it describes the hash you asked about. A
//      receipt that cannot identify itself proves nothing about --tx, and a
//      valid-but-unrelated receipt handed over by an operator is exactly the
//      shape this check exists to refuse.
//   2. The nonce binding. The EIP-3009 nonce is a pure function of the hire:
//      sha256("voidly-session-settlement-binding/v1|" + grantHash) — the same
//      SETTLEMENT_BINDING_DOMAIN @voidly/session exports. EXACTLY ONE
//      AuthorizationUsed event on canonical USDC must carry that nonce,
//      authorized by the payer. Two is ambiguity, and ambiguity refuses.
//   3. The PAIRED Transfer — pairing by log index, not by search. USDC's
//      FiatTokenV2 marks the authorization used immediately BEFORE it emits
//      the Transfer of that same call, so the settled Transfer is the first
//      canonical-USDC Transfer whose logIndex is greater than the
//      AuthorizationUsed's. Payer, payee and value are asserted on THAT log
//      and on no other. This is the check the first version of this file did
//      not have: it searched the whole receipt for any Transfer from the
//      payer, so in a batched transaction hire A's nonce could satisfy the
//      binding while hire B's transfer satisfied the amount. A settlement for
//      a DIFFERENT hire cannot fake this any more.
//      Belt and braces: more than one canonical-USDC payer -> payee Transfer
//      anywhere in the receipt refuses too, rather than a first match winning.
//   4. Exact value on the paired log — `>=` is how amount checks rot.
//   5. Block binding, per operator: eth_getBlockByNumber at the receipt's
//      height must return the receipt's own blockHash on every operator. A
//      receipt agreed on by RPCs but hanging off no block either of them has
//      is not a settlement.
//   6. Confirmation depth: at least 12 blocks after inclusion, from the LOWEST latest head
//      across the quorum — and the heads must agree to within
//      MAX_HEAD_DIVERGENCE blocks, or one operator is not following the
//      chain the other is.
//   7. Quorum: every RPC you name must return a byte-identical receipt.
//      An unanswered endpoint fails the run — unanimity or nothing.
//
// What it does NOT prove: that the work was done, delivered, or any good.
// Payment buys an attempt; delivery is proven by the sealed result and its
// receipt (see verify-artifacts.mjs), never by the chain alone. Nor does it
// prove that --payer, --payee and --amount are the TERMS of the grant whose
// hash you passed: the nonce binds the transaction to the grant hash, and the
// money assertions are made against the values you typed. Read those values
// off your keep file's wire, not off a chat.
//
// Exit 0 PROVEN / 1 REFUSED, with the failed check named / 2 PROVEN-UNPINNED:
// the same checks passed, but at least one operator was one YOU chose with
// --allow-unpinned-rpc rather than one on the reviewed allowlist. That verdict
// is only as strong as those operators and is not a transferable proof.
