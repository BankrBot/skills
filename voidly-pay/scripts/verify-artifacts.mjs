// WHY ATTESTATION MODE IS NO LONGER OFFLINE, AND NO LONGER TAKES ITS TRUST
// ROOT FROM ARGV. Until this fix, attestation mode had no subject binding at
// all and was the only script here that did not import lib/pins.mjs: it took
// the attestor key from `--attestor-key`, never compared it to any verified
// manifest, and never looked at provider_did, chain or asset. A forged
// attestation for a hire that never existed — self-signed, with the forger's
// own key passed on the command line — printed VERIFIED. The comment telling
// you to "take that key from the verified manifest" was the only thing
// enforcing it, and a comment claiming a property is not the property.
//
// So attestation mode binds the artifact to YOUR copy of the grant (grant
// hash, offer hash, capsule hash, both DIDs, chain, asset, price band) and
// takes the signing key from the pinned, signature-verified manifest.
// Passing --attestor-key is still allowed, but it is checked AGAINST the
// manifest rather than believed.
//
// RECEIPT MODE ENFORCES THE PINS TOO. Its trust root is the grant file, and a
// grant file is something anyone can hand you: a grant naming a provider
// that is not the pin, carrying that provider's own keys, with a receipt that
// provider signed, verified fine offline — "signed by the provider key YOUR
// grant names" was true and worthless. So before the SDK is asked anything,
// the grant must name the pinned provider DID, Base, and canonical USDC
// (grant_provider_not_pinned / grant_chain_not_base /
// grant_asset_not_canonical_usdc), and must pass the SDK's own validateGrant
// (grant_invalid — <reason>) so a malformed grant is named as such instead
// of surfacing as a receipt-shaped mismatch. Then verifyDeliveryReceipt binds
// the receipt to that grant (hash, offer, provider DID) and verifies the
// provider's Ed25519 signature under the key the grant carries.
//
// Exit 0 VERIFIED / 1 REFUSED, by name.
