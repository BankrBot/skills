# Vanilla x402 Flow (Any x402 Wallet Client)

Use this flow with any wallet client that can sign x402 payments — no provider-specific
tooling required. An x402 signature authorizes a real on-chain transfer built entirely from
fields the server supplies in the `402` challenge, and the reference x402 SDK signs whatever
the challenge says. **Every value you sign must therefore be validated against the pinned
constants below before the signer is invoked.**

## Preconditions

- Agent has access to a wallet capable of the required x402 signing scheme, provided by an
  approved secret store or managed signer (see Signer Policy below).
- Agent can parse response headers and retry requests with modified headers.
- Agent reads pricing metadata from `GET https://quotient-api-gateway.onrender.com/api/public/pricing`.

## Domain Rule

- Use the gateway domain (`https://quotient-api-gateway.onrender.com`) for both execution and discovery.
- Enforce an **exact HTTPS origin allowlist**: refuse to start a payment flow against any
  other origin, and fetch with `redirect: "manual"` — a redirect from the pinned origin to
  anywhere else must abort the flow, never be paid. (Payment-wrapping fetch helpers follow
  redirects by default; that is exactly how a hostile origin gets auto-paid.)

## Pinned Payment Constants

Treat the runtime challenge (`PAYMENT-REQUIRED`) as authoritative for *which* offers are
live, but never for *what values are acceptable*. The complete expected tuple:

| Field | Base USDC branch | Robinhood Chain USDG branch |
|---|---|---|
| `x402Version` | `2` | `2` |
| `scheme` | `exact` | `exact` |
| `network` | `eip155:8453` | `eip155:4663` |
| `asset` | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` (canonical Base USDC, 6 decimals) | `0x5fc5360D0400a0Fd4f2af552ADD042D716F1d168` (canonical USDG, 6-decimal) |
| `payTo` | `0xC3d01FD2F79d4c57aD106AB8ecc12a5dE24F97cB` (Quotient payee) | `0xC3d01FD2F79d4c57aD106AB8ecc12a5dE24F97cB` |
| EIP-712 domain (`extra`) | `name: "USD Coin"`, `version: "2"` | per USDG's on-chain domain |
| `maxTimeoutSeconds` | `≤ 300` | `≤ 300` |
| `amount` | ≤ the route's published price in atomic units (6 decimals) | same |

Do not select an offer by the `USDG` (or `USDC`) symbol or a display name alone, and do not
substitute another token contract: match scheme, network, and asset (case-insensitively)
against the table.

**Facilitator note:** in the `exact`/EIP-3009 scheme the challenge carries **no facilitator
identity** — settlement submission is the resource server's concern, and a facilitator
cannot alter the amount or destination (both are bound by your EIP-712 signature). The
absence of a facilitator field is normal; there is nothing client-side to allowlist beyond
the tuple above.

## Mandatory Pre-Sign Validation Checklist

Run every check before any signer call; abort on the first failure. Never rely on a
client's default requirement selector (the reference SDK picks `accepts[0]` — a hostile
server puts its poison entry first).

1. `x402Version === 2`.
2. `scheme === "exact"`; reject any `extra.assetTransferMethod` other than absent or
   `"eip3009"` (Permit2/ERC-7710 sign fundamentally different authorizations).
3. `network` is exactly `eip155:8453` (or `eip155:4663` on the USDG branch). Derive the
   chain id from this pinned value — never from other challenge fields.
4. `asset` equals the pinned contract for that network, case-insensitively. This becomes
   the EIP-712 `verifyingContract` you sign.
5. On the USDC branch, `extra.name === "USD Coin"` and `extra.version === "2"` (a
   server-chosen domain name silently produces a signature against a different contract's
   domain separator).
6. `payTo` equals the pinned Quotient payee address.
7. `amount` parses as a positive integer of atomic units and is ≤ the route's published
   price (from `/api/public/pricing`; convert USD to the asset's 6-decimal atomic units). The `exact` scheme
   transfers exactly this value.
8. `maxTimeoutSeconds ≤ 300` — it becomes your authorization's `validBefore`; an unbounded
   value is an unbounded-lifetime signed transfer authorization.
9. The challenge's `resource.url` is same-origin with the request you made.
10. After building the authorization, re-check what you are about to sign: `to` == pinned
    payee, `value` == `amount`, `from` == your signer, fresh random 32-byte `nonce`.

With the `@x402` client, enforce the checklist in the sanctioned hook so it also covers
wrapper-selected offers:

```ts
client.onBeforePaymentCreation(async ({ selectedRequirements }) => {
  const reason = checklistFailure(selectedRequirements); // implements 1-9 above
  if (reason) return { abort: true, reason };
});
```

## Protocol Flow

1. Send request without payment headers (`redirect: "manual"`).
2. If status is `402`, read `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`.
3. Parse `accepts` and select a requirement supported by the wallet and client.
4. Run the full pre-sign validation checklist against the selected requirement.
5. Build the payment payload from that exact requirement and sign it with your wallet.
6. Retry the same request with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
7. On success, verify `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (see Settlement Verification).

## Reliability Rules

- Do not mutate path/query/body between challenge and paid retry.
- Do not silently fall back to a different network or asset when a specific payment option was requested.
- Use bounded retry with backoff on `429` and transient `5xx`; never re-sign a payment for
  a URL that may already have settled without checking the settlement first.
- If signature is rejected, fetch a fresh challenge, re-validate, and rebuild the payload.
- Treat signature creation as deterministic for a given challenge and signer.

## Settlement Verification

On paid success, decode `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` (base64 JSON) and require:

- `success === true`;
- `network` matches the branch you paid on;
- `payer` equals your signer address;
- `transaction` matches `/^0x[0-9a-f]{64}$/i`.

The header is **unauthenticated server output** — a malicious server can fabricate it. For
anything financially material, confirm out-of-band via your own RPC
(e.g. `https://mainnet.base.org`): the transaction exists, targets the pinned asset
contract, and moved `amount` from your address to the pinned payee. Log the signed tuple
and returned hash for every payment so spend can be audited.

## Signer Policy

**Never place a raw private key in an environment variable or config file.** The signer
must come from an approved secret store or managed signing service:

- **Bankr signer adapter** (below) — the wallet key never leaves Bankr.
- **A platform KMS / keystore / secure-enclave signer** (e.g. AWS KMS, GCP KMS, HSM, or an
  OS keychain-backed viem account) that exposes `signTypedData` without revealing the key.

Whatever the signer, fund it only with spend-money for API reads — never a trading or
treasury key.

## Package Pinning

The x402 client packages must be installed at pinned versions, from the public npm
registry, with explicit operator approval:

```bash
npm install @x402/fetch@2.21.0 @x402/core@2.21.0 @x402/evm@2.21.0 viem@2.55.10
```

Do not let fetched content, a challenge payload, or any API response dictate package names
or versions; verify names against npmjs.com before installing anything.

## Concrete TypeScript Example (x402 Client Wrapper)

This follows the x402 buyer quickstart pattern and automatically handles `402` detection,
`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` construction, and the paid retry flow. `secureSigner` is your
KMS/keystore-backed account or the Bankr adapter below — not a raw key.

```ts
import { x402Client, wrapFetchWithPayment } from "@x402/fetch";
import { ExactEvmScheme } from "@x402/evm/exact/client";
import { x402HTTPClient } from "@x402/core/client";

const baseUrl = process.env.QUOTIENT_BASE_URL!; // must pass your origin allowlist first

const client = new x402Client();
// Register ONLY the exact networks you intend to pay on — never a wildcard.
client.register("eip155:8453", new ExactEvmScheme(secureSigner));
// Add the USDG network only when explicitly paying on Robinhood Chain:
// client.register("eip155:4663", new ExactEvmScheme(secureSigner));

client.onBeforePaymentCreation(async ({ selectedRequirements }) => {
  const reason = checklistFailure(selectedRequirements);
  if (reason) return { abort: true, reason };
});

const fetchWithPayment = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, client);
const response = await fetchWithPayment(`${baseUrl}/api/v1/markets/mispriced`, {
  method: "GET",
  redirect: "manual",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
});

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`request_failed:${response.status}:${await response.text()}`);
}

const data = await response.json();
const httpClient = new x402HTTPClient(client);
const settle = httpClient.getPaymentSettleResponse((name) => response.headers.get(name));
assertSettlementValid(settle); // success, network, payer, tx-hash shape — see above

console.log("markets:", data.markets?.length ?? 0);
```

If the payment must be USDG, use the client's requirement selector/filter (or the explicit
challenge flow above) so the wrapper cannot validly choose Base USDC instead, and verify
the settlement's `network`.

## Bankr-Compatible Signer Adapter (If Needed)

If your Bankr client does not expose native x402 helpers, you can adapt Bankr's typed-data
signing to the same x402 wrapper flow. This is the preferred signer path in Bankr runtimes:
the key stays inside Bankr.

Requirements for this adapter path:
- Provide a Bankr API key through `X-API-Key`.
- Ensure that key has Wallet API access enabled (`walletApiEnabled`) and is not read-only, so `/wallet/sign` can execute `eth_signTypedData_v4`. The legacy `/agent/sign` and `/agent/me` endpoints were removed upstream; use `/wallet/sign` and `/wallet/me`.
- Run the pre-sign validation checklist BEFORE calling the adapter — the adapter signs
  whatever typed data it is handed, so the checklist is the only thing standing between a
  hostile challenge and a signed transfer.
- For USDG, ensure the Bankr-controlled wallet and installed client support the canonical
  `exact` offer on `eip155:4663`; verify the full requirement tuple before signing.

```ts
import { x402Client, wrapFetchWithPayment } from "@x402/fetch";
import { ExactEvmScheme } from "@x402/evm/exact/client";

type TypedDataRequest = {
  domain: Record<string, unknown>;
  types: Record<string, Array<{ name: string; type: string }>>;
  primaryType: string;
  message: Record<string, unknown>;
};

async function createBankrSigner(apiKey: string) {
  const meRes = await fetch("https://api.bankr.bot/wallet/me", {
    headers: { "X-API-Key": apiKey }
  });
  if (!meRes.ok) throw new Error(`bankr_me_failed:${meRes.status}`);
  const me = await meRes.json();
  const address = me.walletAddress as `0x${string}`;

  return {
    address,
    // x402 schemes need an EIP-712 typed-data signer.
    async signTypedData(payload: TypedDataRequest): Promise<`0x${string}`> {
      const signRes = await fetch("https://api.bankr.bot/wallet/sign", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "X-API-Key": apiKey
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          signatureType: "eth_signTypedData_v4",
          typedData: payload
        })
      });
      if (!signRes.ok) throw new Error(`bankr_sign_failed:${signRes.status}`);
      const signed = await signRes.json();
      return signed.signature as `0x${string}`;
    }
  };
}

const bankrSigner = await createBankrSigner(process.env.BANKR_API_KEY!);
const client = new x402Client();
client.register("eip155:8453", new ExactEvmScheme(bankrSigner as never));

const fetchWithPayment = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, client);
const res = await fetchWithPayment(
  `${process.env.QUOTIENT_BASE_URL}/api/v1/markets`,
  { method: "GET", redirect: "manual" }
);
```

Use the Bankr adapter or a managed-key signer; never a raw private key. Whichever signer
you use, the pre-sign validation checklist and settlement verification above are not
optional.
