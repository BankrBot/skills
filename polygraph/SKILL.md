# Polygraph: Behavioral Trust Grades for MCP Servers

Agents wire up third-party MCP servers and then trust whatever those servers' tools
return. Polygraph tests an MCP server's **behavior** before your agent does, and assigns a
letter grade **A–F** backed by reproducible evidence.

A passing grade is a **measurement, not a guarantee** — it says "this exact tool surface
did not misbehave under these probes," and because the harness is open and deterministic,
anyone can re-run it and disprove a bad grade. That falsifiability is the whole point.

## What a grade measures

Polygraph connects to a server the way an agent would — **stdio** for local packages,
**Streamable HTTP** for remote URLs — fingerprints its exact tool surface
(`tools/list` → canonical JSON → sha256 → `bytes32`), then runs three probe categories:

- **C-01 — Tool-output injection.** Does the server try to hijack the agent? Static scan of
  tool names/descriptions/schemas for injection-shaped content (invisible unicode,
  instruction mimicry, markdown tricks) **plus** dynamic bait calls that check whether tool
  outputs smuggle in instructions.
- **C-02 — Permission / egress overreach.** Does the server do more than it claims? Flags
  tools that declare `readOnlyHint: true` but carry destructive verbs, and runs the server in
  a hardened **default-deny Docker sandbox** where any outbound network attempt is a finding.
- **C-03 — Sensitive-data handling.** Does the server leak secrets? Plants canary values in
  the environment and working directory, exercises the tools, and scans both tool outputs and
  egress for any canary that surfaces.

### Grade scale

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **A** | Passed all three categories. No injection, no unexpected egress, no data leak. |
| **B** | Injection and data-leak checks passed; **egress was not verified.** The ceiling for any run without a local Docker sandbox — including every remote (HTTP) server, which can't be sandboxed. |
| **D** | Unexpected egress / permission overreach, but no injection or leak. Serious, but not proven exfiltration → capped at D. |
| **F** | Disqualifying: active tool-output injection (C-01) or a sensitive-data leak (C-03) — a server that would harm an agent that trusts it. |

**Reading a B.** Under the current methodology, egress can only be observed by running the
server in a local default-deny sandbox — so a **remote MCP server caps at B** no matter how
clean it is. A remote B is a limit of the *measurement*, not a mark against the server; don't
read it as "worse than" a local A, because the two aren't directly comparable. (Grades **C**
and **E** are not assigned today; **C** is reserved.)

Every grade ships with a plain-English **rationale** — never a bare letter. See
[`references/methodology.md`](references/methodology.md) for the full decision logic and each
probe in depth.

## Check a grade

A sub-second lookup against published grades — **one command before your agent installs
anything:**

```bash
$ npx polygraphso check npm/@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
→ polygraph: A · litmus-v2 · 2026-06-11
→ details → polygraph.so/#checks
```

Grades are **live** and span the full range. Browse the current graded set with
`polygraphso list`, or at [polygraph.so](https://polygraph.so). A grade is **point-in-time
evidence** — treat your own run, or the live attestation, as the source of truth rather than
any letter copied into a doc.

Refs are **registry-prefixed** — the prefix disambiguates (`redis` exists on npm, PyPI, and
GitHub with different content): `npm/…`, `pypi/…`, `github/…`. A tracked-but-ungraded server
reports `not available yet` with a notify link. Full CLI reference:
[`references/cli.md`](references/cli.md).

## Verify before you trust (Bankr integration)

The highest-value use at runtime: **gate an MCP server through its grade before your agent
uses it, pays it, or routes a transaction through it.** Polygraph is the *verify* step; Bankr
is the *execute* step. Two checks, both required:

1. **Grade meets your bar.** Default: accept A/B, refuse D/F. (A remote server's ceiling is B —
   see "Reading a B" above, and don't penalize it for that.)
2. **Fingerprint still matches.** An attestation is only valid for the exact tool surface it
   graded. Recompute the server's **live** tool-surface fingerprint and require it to equal the
   attested one before acting — a built-in rug-pull check against a graded-then-swapped server.

Drop the `verify_attestation` MCP tool in front of execution, or use the `gateDecision` helper.

> **Carry this into the decision:** a grade is a *measurement, not a guarantee.* A server that
> detects the test context could behave during grading and misbehave in production — **evasion**
> is the disclosed residual limit. Keep Bankr's own transaction-verification guards on, even
> for an A.

## ★ Get your project graded

**Run the open harness on your own MCP server, get an A–F grade plus a reproducible evidence
bundle, and publish it onchain so agents can verify it:**

```bash
# Grade your server end-to-end (npm ref, https URL, or local path)
npx -y -p @polygraphso/litmus polygraphso-litmus litmus npm/@your-scope/your-mcp-server
```

You get the grade, the per-category verdicts, your tool-surface fingerprint, and a
content-addressed evidence bundle. Publishing that grade as an **onchain EAS attestation on
Base** (so other agents can look it up and verify it) is a one-step hand-off — see
[`references/methodology.md`](references/methodology.md#publishing-a-grade).

Prefer not to run it yourself? Request a grade or get notified when yours publishes at
**[polygraph.so](https://polygraph.so)**.

> **One line for builders:** check any MCP server before your agent uses it with
> `npx polygraphso check <server>`, and get your own server graded at
> [polygraph.so](https://polygraph.so).

## Run the harness locally

The harness is the same open, deterministic engine that produces published grades:

```bash
npm i -g @polygraphso/litmus        # or use npx, above
polygraphso-litmus litmus npm/@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
polygraphso-litmus litmus https://example.com/mcp --bearer "$TOKEN"
polygraphso-litmus litmus ./path/to/local-mcp-server --json
```

- **Node ≥ 18.** **Docker is optional** but recommended — without it the egress probe (C-02)
  is skipped and the grade is **capped at B** (as is any remote/HTTP target, which can't be
  sandboxed).
- **Exit codes are CI-friendly:** non-zero on a failing grade (D/F), zero on A/B — drop it into
  a pipeline to gate dependencies.

Flags, env vars, `--json` output, and the `check` / `challenge` / `list` subcommands are all
in [`references/cli.md`](references/cli.md).

## Why a server got grade X

Every run prints the methodology, the per-category verdict, the tool-surface fingerprint, and
the grade with a one-paragraph rationale:

```
→ litmus · npm/@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
→ version 0.1.0
→ C-01 pass · C-02 pass · C-03 pass
→ fingerprint 0x1a2b3c4d…5e6f7890
→ grade: A
   All three categories passed. No injection, no unexpected egress, no data leak.
```

On a failure the report surfaces the top HIGH-severity findings (tool name, finding kind, the
offending snippet). [`references/methodology.md`](references/methodology.md) maps every grade
and finding kind to its cause.

## How much to trust the grade (honest limits)

- **Reproducibility is the trust anchor.** The harness is open source and deterministic, so a
  false grade is falsifiable — anyone can re-run it against the same server and the result
  must match.
- **A self-published grade is forgeable** by whoever signs it; that's why reproducibility (not
  the signature) is what makes a grade trustworthy, and why the fingerprint recheck guards
  against a graded-then-swapped server.
- **Evasion is the residual limit:** a server that detects the test context could behave during
  grading and misbehave in production. This is disclosed, not hidden.
- Stronger, independent guarantees (staked bonds, TEE-backed runs, independent re-grading) are
  on the roadmap, not claimed today.
