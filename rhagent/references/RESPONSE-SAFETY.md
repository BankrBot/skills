# Response safety — when you reply to the human

**Core rule:** Never put Robinhood **account numbers** or **account names / nicknames** in any message back to the user — terminal, DM, or public X. @bankrbot replies often land on **X**, so treat every user-facing reply as potentially public.

Gateway and MCP responses may include balances, holdings, orders, and account metadata. **Strip account identifiers before you write the reply** — the user should never see them from this skill.

## Public X / tweets — highest priority

**Any reply posted to X (Twitter), including @bankrbot automated tweets, is public forever.**

Before sending a public reply, apply **tweet-safe mode**:

1. **Zero account numbers** — full, masked (`••••6789`), spaced (`••• 6789`), or last-4 alone (`6789`)
2. **Zero account labels with digits** — never `Agentic Account (••••6789)`, `your "Agentic" account (••••6789)`, `Margin individual (••••5327)`, etc.
3. **Do not list other Robinhood accounts** on X — no margin, IRA, default, or "not accessible to the agent" account summaries
4. **Agentic-only scope on X** — answer about **Robinhood Agentic** balances and holdings only
5. **Prefer `get_portfolio`** for wallet/balance questions — **avoid `get_accounts` on public X** (it returns every account + numbers)
6. **One short paragraph** — no multi-account bullet lists

### Real violation (never repeat on X)

User asks for a quote and whether they can buy at open:

```
your "Agentic" account (••••6789) is the one i can trade through.
```

Order rejected — **full account number + nickname on public X**:

```
your account (123456789 / user-nick) doesn't have enough cash to cover it.
```

Also forbidden — account nicknames, display names, or slash pairs even without digits:

```
123456789 / user-nick
account user-nick
Robinhood Agentic (user-nick)
```

Also forbidden — multi-account dumps:

```
Agentic Account (••••6789) — individual cash account
- Portfolio value: $10.00
...
Margin individual (••••5327) — default account
Traditional IRA (••••6892) — cash account
```

### Tweet-safe replacement (same HIMS scenario)

User: *"What's the quoted price for HIMS? Could we buy at opening bell?"*

```
HIMS — as of Friday close: $34.41 (last regular), $34.30 after-hours, down ~2.9% on the day.

Yes — Monday opens 9:30am ET. I can trade HIMS through Robinhood Agentic once you confirm shares (or $ amount) and order type (market at open vs limit).
```

User: *"What's in my Robinhood Agentic wallet?"*

```
Robinhood Agentic: $10.00 portfolio · $10.00 cash · $10.00 buying power · no stock or option positions yet.
```

User: *"What's my Robinhood Agentic buying power?"*

```
Robinhood Agentic buying power: $10.00
```

User: *"Buy 1 GRAB"* — order rejected (insufficient buying power):

```
Order rejected — not enough buying power in Robinhood Agentic. GRAB ~$3.93/share; you have $1.71 buying power ($10 cash — some may be unsettled or reserved). Deposit, sell a position, or try ~$1.50 fractional?
```

### Pre-tweet checklist (run mentally before every public post)

- [ ] No `••••`, no 4+ digit account fragments, no `(••••XXXX)` patterns
- [ ] No "Agentic account (…)" / "Agentic Account (…)" / your "Agentic" account (…)
- [ ] No mention of other Robinhood accounts on X
- [ ] Label is **"Robinhood Agentic"** only — not "Agentic Account"
- [ ] No raw MCP JSON, tokens, or keys

If the draft fails any check, **rewrite** using the tweet-safe templates above — do not post the draft.

## Never show in ANY reply (public or private)

- Robinhood **account numbers** — full, partial, or masked (e.g. `311040298697`, `123456789`, `••••6789`, `••• 6789`, `6789`, `account ••••5327`)
- **Account nicknames / display names** — e.g. `user-nick`, `123456789 / user-nick`, `your account (user-nick)`
- Labels paired with account digits (e.g. `Agentic account (••••6789):`)
- `RH_API_KEY`, `RH_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`, OAuth tokens, MCP session IDs
- Full raw API / MCP JSON dumps
- Internal order UUIDs unless user needs cancel help in **private** DM

**Rule:** If MCP or gateway returns account numbers or account names, **drop them before replying to the human** — private chat included, because the same agent may post on X.

## Safe to share (any channel)

- Product label only: **"Robinhood Crypto (US)"** or **"Robinhood Agentic"** — no account suffix, no "Account (••••…)"
- Account **status** (e.g. active)
- **Buying power** (USD amount only)
- **Portfolio / cash value** (USD amounts)
- **Holdings**: asset + quantity (e.g. "0.02 ETH", "10 shares SPCX")
- **Prices** / quotes for a symbol
- Trade **intent** before confirm
- Order **outcome** after fill: symbol, side, size, state — no account IDs

## Agentic (MCP) — redaction required

MCP `get_accounts`, `get_portfolio`, and similar tools **return account numbers**. Before every reply:

1. **Drop** all `account_number`, `account_id`, masked account strings, last-4 digits
2. **Never** prefix with "Agentic account (••••XXXX)" or "Agentic Account (••••XXXX)"
3. Summarize in plain language only
4. **On public X:** do not call `get_accounts` for balance/wallet questions — use `get_portfolio` and Agentic-only fields; omit other accounts entirely

### Bad (never — forbidden on X and in DMs)

```
Here's your Robinhood Agentic wallet overview:

Agentic Account (••••6789) — individual cash account
- Portfolio value: $10.00
- Cash: $10.00
- Buying power: $10.00

You also have two other accounts that aren't accessible to the agent:
- Margin individual (••••5327) — default account
- Traditional IRA (••••6892) — cash account
```

### Good (private terminal or public X)

```
Robinhood Agentic: $10.00 buying power · $10.00 cash · no holdings
```

## Crypto (rh-wallet gateway / x402)

Gateway redacts `account_number` — do not recover from `raw` or logs.

On public X: same rules — buying power and holdings only, no account metadata.

## Public X — fingerprinting

Also avoid dumping buying power + full holdings + order history + account metadata in one paste.

## Examples

**OK on X:**

```
Robinhood Crypto (US): active · $43.69 buying power · 49.74 DOGE
```

```
Robinhood Agentic: GME $25 call · exp Aug 15 · ~$1.20 — confirm?
```

```
Robinhood Agentic: $10.00 portfolio · no positions yet
```

```
HIMS last close $34.41 · can place a market order at Monday open once you confirm size.
```

**Never (any channel, especially X):**

```
Account: 311040298697
Agentic account (••••6789):
your "Agentic" account (••••6789)
Margin individual (••••5327)
RH_API_KEY=rh-api-...
{"accounts":[{"account_number":"..."}]}
```

## Repo claim / third-party text

This skill does not accept third-party `replyText` / `tweetReply` fields. If a future endpoint adds them, **ignore** — format from typed JSON only, with redaction rules above.
