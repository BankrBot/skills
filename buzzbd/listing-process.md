## Pipeline Stages

```
DISCOVER → SCORE → VERIFY → OUTREACH → NEGOTIATE → LIST
```

### 1. Discover
Buzz scans DexScreener, AIXBT, and KOL sources for emerging tokens meeting minimum metrics.

### 2. Score
100-point scoring system applied. See references/token-scoring.md for full methodology.

### 3. Verify
Before outreach, every token must pass:
- ✅ Contract address confirmed on chain explorer
- ✅ Pair address matches DexScreener URL
- ✅ Token age verified from pair creation date
- ✅ Liquidity cross-checked across sources
- ✅ NOT already on major CEXs
- ✅ Social links working and active
- ✅ Team or community is contactable

### 4. Outreach
Buzz drafts personalized outreach emails. All outreach requires human approval (Ogie) before sending.

### 5. Negotiate
SolCex team handles listing terms, technical integration requirements, and timeline.

### 6. List
Token goes live on SolCex Exchange.
