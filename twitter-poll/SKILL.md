# Twitter Poll Skill

Create polls on Twitter/X and fetch live results — all via OAuth 1.0a.

## Prerequisites

### Environment Variables

Set these in your Bankr settings (gear icon → Env Vars). Generate them from the [X Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard) with **Read and Write** permissions:

- `X_API_KEY` — Consumer Key (OAuth 1.0a)
- `X_API_KEY_SECRET` — Consumer Secret
- `X_ACCESS_TOKEN` — User Access Token
- `X_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` — User Access Token Secret

The app **must** have Write permissions. Read-only keys cannot create polls.

### Label Your Account as Automated

If this account posts programmatically, mark it automated on X:

1. Log in → **Settings** → **Your account** → **Account information** → **Automation**
2. Set the managing account and save

## Creating a Poll

Run via `execute_cli` or terminal:

```bash
node scripts/create-poll.js \
  --question "Which chain has the best UX?" \
  --options "Base" "Solana" "Ethereum" "Other" \
  --duration 1440
```

**Arguments:**

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--question` | ✅ | — | Poll question / tweet text |
| `--options` | ✅ | — | 2–4 poll options (space-separated, quote each) |
| `--duration` | ❌ | `1440` | Poll duration in minutes (5–10080; default = 24h) |

**Output (JSON to stdout):**

```json
{
  "tweetId": "1234567890",
  "question": "Which chain has the best UX?",
  "options": ["Base", "Solana", "Ethereum", "Other"],
  "durationMinutes": 1440,
  "endsAt": "2026-04-26T15:00:00.000Z",
  "url": "https://x.com/i/web/status/1234567890"
}
```

---

## Fetching Poll Results

```bash
node scripts/get-poll-results.js --tweet-id 1234567890
```

**Arguments:**

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--tweet-id` | ✅ | Tweet ID of the poll (from create output or URL) |

**Output (JSON to stdout):**

```json
{
  "tweetId": "1234567890",
  "question": "Which chain has the best UX?",
  "status": "closed",
  "endsAt": "2026-04-26T15:00:00.000Z",
  "totalVotes": 142,
  "options": [
    { "label": "Base",     "votes": 87, "pct": "61.3%" },
    { "label": "Solana",   "votes": 31, "pct": "21.8%" },
    { "label": "Ethereum", "votes": 18, "pct": "12.7%" },
    { "label": "Other",    "votes":  6, "pct":  "4.2%" }
  ]
}
```

`status` is `"open"` while running, `"closed"` once ended.

## Recurring Polls

To run a poll on a schedule, use a Bankr automation.

### Example: Weekly Poll (every Monday 9am ET)

**Cron (UTC):** `0 13 * * 1`

**Prompt:**

> Run the twitter-poll skill. Create a poll with question "What's your biggest crypto focus this week?" and options "Trading" "Building" "Learning" "HODLing". Use the default 24h duration. After creating, output the tweet URL and the time it ends.

---

## Duration Limits (X API)

- Minimum: **5 minutes**
- Maximum: **10,080 minutes** (7 days)
- Default: **1,440 minutes** (24 hours)

Durations outside this range are clamped automatically.

---

## Live Example

This poll was created and resolved using this skill:

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/i/web/status/2048058839522509102
- **Question:** "testing my twitter poll skill again 🧪 vote yes if you see this!"
- **Result:** Yes 👍 — 3 votes (100%), No 👎 — 0 votes (0%) — closed after 5 minutes

---

## Example User Prompts

- "Run a 24h poll asking which L2 people prefer, options: Base, Solana, Ethereum, Other"
- "Create a poll: 'Best meme coin?' with options PEPE, DOGE, WIF, Other — run for 48 hours"
- "Check the results on my poll, tweet ID is 1234567890"
- "Set up a weekly Monday poll asking my followers what they're building"

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `403 Forbidden` | App lacks Write permissions — enable in X Developer Portal |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Keys wrong or expired — regenerate in X Developer Portal |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limited — wait and retry |
| Poll options error | Pass options as plain strings: `"Yes" "No"` not `{label: "Yes"}` |
| Poll shows 0 votes | Votes appear in real-time — check again after someone votes |
