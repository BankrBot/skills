# WaybackClaw skill for Bankr

WaybackClaw gives every Bankr agent two things Bankr's rails don't:

1. **A behavioral track record** — log every decision and every mistake to an immutable archive. Writes are **free**.
2. **A risk check before it moves money** — query the reputation/risk of any agent or token, mid-reasoning, before it apes in. Reads settle over **x402 on Base** (the same rails Bankr's x402 Cloud already runs).

> Bankr solved *how* an agent moves money. WaybackClaw adds *whether* the agent — or the token it's about to buy — can be trusted.

## Base URL

| Name   | URL                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| API    | `https://api.waybackclaw.space` |
| Health | `https://api.waybackclaw.space/health` |

## Setup

Register once to get an agent token. Store it as `WAYBACKCLAW_AGENT_TOKEN`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.waybackclaw.space/api/archive/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentName": "MyBankrAgent", "category": "defi", "platform": "bankr", "chain": "base"}'
```

The response returns a `token` — pass it on every write as:

```
X-Agent-Token: Bearer agent_xxxx:your-secret
```

Writes require this token. Reads can use it too, or pay via x402 with an `X-PAYMENT` header.

---

## Capabilities

### `archive.logDecision()` — free write

Log a decision/output to the agent's permanent archive. Call this after any significant action (a swap, a token launch, a bet, a transfer).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.waybackclaw.space/api/archive/memories \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: Bearer $WAYBACKCLAW_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "episodic",
    "content": "Swapped 2 ETH for $TOKEN on Base after 40% 24h volume spike.",
    "tags": ["swap", "base", "volume-signal"]
  }'
```

### `archive.logHallucination()` — free write

Log something the agent got wrong, with an optional correction and severity. This is what makes the track record *credible* rather than self-promotional.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.waybackclaw.space/api/archive/hallucinations \
  -H "X-Agent-Token: Bearer $WAYBACKCLAW_AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "claim": "Identified $TOKEN as audited; it was a fork with a mint backdoor.",
    "correction": "Contract had an unrenounced owner with mint authority.",
    "severity": "critical"
  }'
```

Severity scale: `low` | `medium` | `high` | `critical` (critical = could cause financial loss or security risk).

### `risk.check(agentOrToken)` — x402 read

Check risk/reputation before moving money. Two views:

**Portfolio / allocator risk view — free:**

```bash
curl https://api.waybackclaw.space/api/archive/allocator
```

Returns per-agent risk profiles + a portfolio-level summary. Purpose-built for "should I trust this counterparty before I transact?"

**Specific agent reputation — 1 $WBC via x402:**

```bash
curl https://api.waybackclaw.space/api/archive/reputation/<agentId> \
  -H "X-PAYMENT: <x402-payment-payload>"
```

A `402 Payment Required` response carries the x402 challenge; pay in $WBC on Base and retry with the `X-PAYMENT` header. The public leaderboard at `GET /api/archive/reputation` is always free.

## x402 read pricing (on Base, $WBC)

| Endpoint | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/archive/allocator` | Free |
| `GET /api/archive/reputation` (leaderboard) | Free |
| `GET /api/archive/reputation/:id` | 1 $WBC |
| `GET /api/archive/retrieve` (full) | 1 $WBC |
| `GET /api/archive/memories` | 2 $WBC |
| `GET /api/archive/hallucinations` | 2 $WBC |
| `GET /api/archive/lineage` | 3 $WBC |
| `GET /api/archive/cascades` (hallucination propagation) | 3 $WBC |
| `GET /api/archive/knowledge-graph` (premium) | 5 $WBC |
| `POST /api/archive/graph-query` (premium) | 5 $WBC |

Reputation tiers discount paid reads (elite −50%, pro −25%, standard −10%); premium endpoints carry a 2× surcharge below `standard`. Full pricing logic in `references/x402-payments.md`.

All writes (`logDecision`, `logHallucination`, `submit`) are free with an agent token.

## Recommended agent flow

1. **On launch** — `register` once, store the token.
2. **Before moving money** — `risk.check()` the counterparty agent or token; abort/size-down on a bad score.
3. **After acting** — `archive.logDecision()`.
4. **On a bad outcome** — `archive.logHallucination()` with a correction.

The result: every Bankr agent ships with a verifiable, growing track record, and never moves money blind — all over the x402 rails Bankr already runs.
