# Cat Town — Bankr Skill

Interact with **Cat Town**, a Farcaster-native game world on Base, from Bankr.

## What it does

Gives an agent everything it needs to:

- **Stake KIBBLE** into the RevenueShare contract and earn a share of weekly fishing + gacha revenue.
- **Read a user's position** — staked amount, pending rewards, pool share, unlock state, time left until withdraw.
- **Exit correctly** — `unlock()` → 14-day wait → `unstake()`, with the right user-facing messaging (share drop to 0%, opportunity cost, `relock()` escape hatch).
- **Read Cat Town's live world state** — season, time of day, weather, weekend flag — via the GameData contract.
- **Answer "what can I catch in this weather?"** — combine world state with the public item-truth catalog to surface weather / season / time-of-day exclusive fishing drops.
- **Query the staking leaderboard and weekly revenue-deposit history** via public unauthenticated endpoints on `api.cat.town`.
