# RevenueShare Contract Reference

Single-pool, single-reward staking for KIBBLE on Base. Deployed as a UUPS proxy (upgradeable) — always read values like `LOCK_PERIOD()` from chain rather than hardcoding.

## Addresses

## Reward accounting model

Masterchef-style single pool:

```
pendingRewards(user) = (userStaked(user) * (accRewardPerShare - rewardDebt(user))) / 1e18
```

- `accRewardPerShare` is updated on each `depositRevenue(amount, source)` call:
  ```
  accRewardPerShare += (amount * 1e18) / totalActiveStaked
  ```
- `rewardDebt(user)` is snapshotted on every user action (`stake`, `claim`, `claimAndRestake`, `unlock`, `relock`, `unstake`).
- Users in an `unlock()` window are subtracted from `totalActiveStaked`, so they neither earn nor dilute active stakers.

## Write functions

All `amount` parameters are `uint256` **wei** — KIBBLE has 18 decimals, so a human amount `N` maps to `N * 10^18`. Apply this scaling exactly once; double-encoding (multiplying by `10^18` twice) is the most common cause of `ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance` reverts on `stake`. Quick sanity check: for any amount `≤ 1e15`, you almost certainly forgot to encode; for any amount `≥ 1e30`, you almost certainly encoded twice.

The address that submits a write must be the same address that (a) holds the KIBBLE balance and (b) granted the allowance. If a smart wallet executes the tx, the balance must sit on the smart wallet — not on an attached EOA.

### `stake(uint256 amount)`

Pulls `amount` KIBBLE from `msg.sender` (requires prior ERC-20 approval) and credits it to the user's position. Emits `Staked(indexed address user, uint256 amount)`.

Reverts if:
- Allowance too low (standard ERC-20 revert)
- `amount == 0` (check if ambiguous; safer for agents to always pass > 0)

### `unstake(uint256 amount)`

Returns `amount` KIBBLE to `msg.sender`. Emits `Unstaked(indexed address user, uint256 amount)`.

Reverts if:
- `isUnlocking[user] == true` and `block.timestamp < unlockEndTime[user]`
- `amount > getUserStaked(user)`

### `unlock()`

Starts the exit wait. Sets `isUnlocking[user] = true`, `unlockStartTime[user] = block.timestamp`, `unlockEndTime[user] = block.timestamp + LOCK_PERIOD()`. Removes the user's stake from `totalActiveStaked`. Emits `UnlockInitiated(indexed address user, uint256 unlockEndTime)`.

### `relock()`

Cancels an in-progress unlock. Sets `isUnlocking[user] = false` and returns the user to `totalActiveStaked`. Emits `Relocked(indexed address user, uint256 amount)`.

### `claim()`

Transfers `pendingRewards(user)` KIBBLE to `msg.sender` and updates `rewardDebt`. Emits `Claimed(indexed address user, uint256 amount)`.

### `claimAndRestake()`

Computes `pendingRewards(user)` and adds it directly to the user's stake (no token transfer out, no ERC-20 approval needed). Emits `ClaimedAndRestaked(indexed address user, uint256 restakedAmount, uint256 totalStakedNow)`.

## Transaction-building checklist

For any stake flow, before constructing calldata:

1. Convert the human amount to wei **once**: `amount_wei = human_amount * 10^18`. Use BigInt math — a plain JS `Number` will lose precision above ~9e15.
2. Read `allowance(user, revenueShare)` on the KIBBLE token. If `< amount_wei`, include an `approve(revenueShare, amount_wei)` tx first.
3. Read `balanceOf(user)` on the KIBBLE token. Confirm `amount_wei ≤ balanceOf(user)`. If balance is short, surface a clear error; don't submit a tx that will revert.
4. Confirm the tx sender address equals the user address holding KIBBLE. A smart-wallet / relay setup that changes `msg.sender` will cause a balance-exceeds revert even if the "user" has tokens.
5. For `unstake`: read `isUnlocking(user)` and `unlockEndTime(user)`. Abort with a clear error if the wait isn't over.
6. For any write, `getUserStaked(user)` and `pendingRewards(user)` are cheap reads that help you give an accurate pre-tx preview.
