# Cat Town — Agent Overview

Cat Town is a Farcaster-native game world on Base. Players fish, collect, and earn KIBBLE; a share of town revenue is streamed weekly to KIBBLE stakers. This skill lets agents read Cat Town state and submit the transactions needed to participate.

The town's NPCs run each activity and are worth naming when talking to players:

- **Wealth & Whiskers Bank** — where KIBBLE staking happens. **Theodore** works the day shift, **Cassie** takes over in the evening.
- **Paulie** — runs the weekly fish raffle.
- **Skipper** — the weekday fishing NPC.
- **Isabella** — hosts the weekend fishing competition.

Current coverage:

- KIBBLE staking via the **RevenueShare** contract — stake, claim, claim-and-restake, unlock, relock, unstake.
- The staking leaderboard and a user's deposit history (public unauthenticated JSON API).
- The weekly event calendar (fishing revenue, gacha revenue, fishing competition, fish raffle).

This SKILL.md will grow as more Cat Town surfaces (fish raffle entries, fishing-competition reads) are added. The calendar here is the shared reference — expect future sections to point back at it.

## Weekly Calendar (all times UTC)

Cat Town runs on a fixed weekly cadence. Use these timings when setting user expectations ("your next fishing drop is Monday") or scheduling follow-ups.

| Day       | Event                             | Time                       | Host              | Affects staking rewards? |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Monday    | **Fishing revenue deposit**       | by 12:00 (often earlier)   | Theodore / Cassie | Yes                      |
| Mon–Fri   | Fish raffle ticket sales open     | —                          | Paulie            | No                       |
| Mon–Fri   | Weekday fishing                   | —                          | Skipper           | No                       |
| Wednesday | **Gacha revenue deposit**         | by 12:00 (often earlier)   | Theodore / Cassie | Yes                      |
| Friday    | **Fish raffle draw**              | 20:00                      | Paulie            | No                       |
| Sat–Sun   | **Weekly fishing competition**    | Sat morning → Sun night    | Isabella          | Indirect*                |

*During the weekend fishing competition (Sat–Sun), 10% of every fish identification feeds the KIBBLE stakers pool. Weekday fishing (Skipper) does **not** feed stakers. This is why weekend activity sizes the following Monday's fishing-revenue deposit. See [references/cattown-calendar.md](references/cattown-calendar.md) for the full revenue split.

Deposits are triggered by the Cat Town backend calling `depositRevenue(amount, source)` on RevenueShare, with `source` in `"fishing"` or `"gacha"`. Watch the `RevenueDeposited(string source, uint256 depositTimestamp, uint256 depositAmount, uint256 newAccRewardPerShare)` event to know the exact moment a drop lands.

## KIBBLE Staking

### Addresses (Base, chain id 8453)

- **RevenueShare**: `0x9e1Ced3b5130EBfff428eE0Ff471e4Df5383C0a1`
- **KIBBLE token (ERC-20, 18 decimals)**: `0x64cc19A52f4D631eF5BE07947CABA14aE00c52Eb`

Base Sepolia addresses and the full ABI surface are in [references/staking-contract.md](references/staking-contract.md).

### Amount units — read this before building any write tx

All `amount` parameters on RevenueShare and the KIBBLE `approve` call are in **base units (wei)**, not human KIBBLE. KIBBLE has **18 decimals**, so:

- Stake 100 KIBBLE → pass `amount = 100 * 10^18 = 100000000000000000000`
- Approve 100 KIBBLE → pass `amount = 100 * 10^18 = 100000000000000000000`
- Apply `* 10^18` **exactly once**. Double-encoding (multiplying by `10^18` twice) produces a value larger than any plausible balance and causes `ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance` — see Troubleshooting.
- **Signer = holder.** The address that signs `stake` must be the same address that holds the KIBBLE and signed `approve`. If a smart wallet executes the tx, the balance must sit on that smart wallet — not on an attached EOA.

### Core flows

Single pool, single reward token — KIBBLE in, KIBBLE out. No reward-token selection, no per-user lock duration, no multipliers. One global `accRewardPerShare` accumulator updated on each `depositRevenue`.

**1. Stake**
1. `kibble.approve(revenueShare, amount)` — required once if `allowance(user, revenueShare) < amount`.
2. `revenueShare.stake(uint256 amount)` — emits `Staked(user, amount)`.

**2. Claim** (after each fishing/gacha deposit)
- `revenueShare.claim()` — transfers `pendingRewards(user)` to the user. Emits `Claimed(user, amount)`.
- `revenueShare.claimAndRestake()` — claims and auto-adds to the user's stake in one tx. Emits `ClaimedAndRestaked(user, restakedAmount, totalStakedNow)`.

**3. Exit (unlock → wait → unstake)**
1. `revenueShare.unlock()` — emits `UnlockInitiated(user, unlockEndTime)`. Sets `isUnlocking[user] = true`.
2. Wait until `block.timestamp >= unlockEndTime(user)`. The wait length is `LOCK_PERIOD()` — **always read this from chain; do not hardcode** (the contract is UUPS-upgradeable).
3. `revenueShare.unstake(uint256 amount)` — reverts before the wait ends. Emits `Unstaked(user, amount)`.
- `revenueShare.relock()` — at any time during the wait, cancels the unlock and puts the user back into the earning pool. Emits `Relocked(user, amount)`.

### Unlock state machine — the gotcha to warn users about

```
 [staking, earning] ──unlock()──▶ [unlocking, NOT earning] ──wait LOCK_PERIOD──▶ [unstake available]
         ▲                               │                                              │
         └────────── relock() ───────────┘                                              │
         │                                                                              │
         └────────────────────── unstake(amount) ◀──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

While `isUnlocking[user] == true`:
- The user's balance is in `totalStaked()` but **excluded from `totalActiveStaked()`**.
- Reward math divides by `totalActiveStaked`, so the user **does not accrue rewards** during the unlock window.
- `unstake()` reverts until `unlockEndTime(user)` has passed.

Recommend users `claim()` any pending rewards first, then `unlock()`, then `unstake()` once the wait is over. If they change their mind mid-wait, `relock()` is free and returns them to the earning pool instantly.

### Staking leaderboard & user deposit history

Two public JSON endpoints on `https://api.cat.town`, **no auth required**. Use these whenever the user wants their rank, their share of the pool, or their weekly earnings history without paying RPC costs.

- `GET /v2/revenue/staking/leaderboard` — ranked stakers with stake amount and pool-share %.
- `GET /v2/revenue/deposits/{address}` — one user's historical `fishing` / `gacha` deposits, per-tx amounts, and the share that landed for that user.

Full shapes, field meanings, and example responses: [references/staking-api.md](references/staking-api.md).

## Executing transactions via Bankr

For any write call (`approve`, `stake`, `claim`, `claimAndRestake`, `unlock`, `relock`, `unstake`):

Natural-language Bankr agent prompt:

```bash
bankr agent prompt "Stake 1000 KIBBLE in Cat Town"
```

Or encode calldata and submit directly:

```bash
bankr wallet submit --to 0x9e1Ced3b5130EBfff428eE0Ff471e4Df5383C0a1 --data <encoded-calldata> --chain base
```

Remember: submit the ERC-20 `approve` on the KIBBLE token (`0x64cc19A52f4D631eF5BE07947CABA14aE00c52Eb`, target = RevenueShare) before `stake` if the current allowance is insufficient.

---

## Pitfalls

- **Forgetting the approval.** `stake` reverts cleanly but wastes a user's tx. Read `allowance(user, revenueShare)` first; only approve if low.
- **Unstaking while unlocking.** Reverts. Check `isUnlocking(user)` and `unlockEndTime(user)` before constructing an `unstake` tx.
- **Assuming continuous rewards.** `pendingRewards` is a step function — it only goes up when the backend calls `depositRevenue`. Between deposits, polling will show no change, and that is correct. Use the calendar above to set expectations.
- **Hardcoding `LOCK_PERIOD`.** Read it from chain every time — the contract is UUPS-upgradeable.
- **Using the legacy contract.** An older staking contract (`0xc3398Ae89bAE27620Ad4A9216165c80EE654eE96`) exists but is deprecated. Do not send new stakes there.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance` on `stake`

The approval succeeded, but `stake(amount)` reverts with this message. The OpenZeppelin `transferFrom` checks allowance first, then balance — so this specific error means allowance is fine but **the amount exceeds the signer's KIBBLE balance**. Two likely causes:

1. **Double-encoded amount.** If you're asked to stake 100 KIBBLE and you encode to wei twice, you get `100 * 10^36` instead of `100 * 10^18`. That's larger than any plausible balance. Fix: apply `* 10^18` exactly once. Diagnostic test: call `stake(1)` (literal uint256 `1` = 1 wei). If that succeeds, encoding was the problem.
2. **Signer ≠ holder.** The address executing the stake is not the address holding KIBBLE. Common when a smart wallet executes but the balance sits on an attached EOA, or when a session/relay wallet submits on behalf of a user. Confirm `msg.sender` of the stake tx matches the address that holds KIBBLE and signed the approval.

### `ERC20: insufficient allowance` on `stake`

`allowance(signer, revenueShare) < stakeAmount`. Submit `approve(revenueShare, stakeAmount_in_wei)` from the same signer first. Remember the approval is on the KIBBLE token, not on RevenueShare.

### `unstake` reverts with no obvious reason

Check `isUnlocking(signer)`. If `true`, `unstake` reverts until `block.timestamp >= unlockEndTime(signer)`. Either wait out the window or call `relock()` to cancel the unlock and return to the earning pool.

### Diagnostic no-arg write tests

If you want to verify the signer + contract are wired up without worrying about amount encoding, try either:

- `unlock()` — no args. Succeeds even with 0 staked (sets `isUnlocking = true`). Follow with `relock()` immediately to avoid side effects.
- `claim()` — no args. No-ops cleanly when `pendingRewards(signer) == 0`.
